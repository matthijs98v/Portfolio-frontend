        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Matthijs Verheijen and I come from the Netherlands. My
          hobbies are drawing, design, photography, and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am the type of person who likes to learn new things as well as
          getting better as I go further.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like programming and design because, that way I am able to bring my
          ideas to life. Both in a functional way as well as in a visual way.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally I like to share my projects and ideas. As well as
          explaining why I did something in a particular way.
        </p>
        <p>If you have any ideas, feel free to contact me if you want :)</p>
